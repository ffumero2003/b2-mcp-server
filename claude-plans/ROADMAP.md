# Roadmap

The full parked list, across all plans. A plan's Out of scope section points
here instead of repeating it. Move an item to Done with the plan number that
shipped it; add new items as later plans park them.

## Planned — committed for this version

- File operations: list, upload, download, delete. (parked by 001)
- Bucket quota reporting — the "buckets over 80% quota" use case in the
  Overview. (parked by 001)
- Application key management: create, list, delete. (parked by 001)

## Possible — noted, not committed

- bucketId / bucketName / bucketTypes filters on b2_list_buckets. (parked by 001)
- HTTP/SSE transport alongside stdio. (parked by 001)
- Named credential profiles, for one operator with several B2 accounts. Tools
  would take a profile NAME, never a secret. (parked by 001)
- Runtime credential prompting via MCP elicitation (server.elicitInput(),
  confirmed present in @modelcontextprotocol/sdk 1.30.0, form and url modes).
  Caveat: elicitation form fields are plain string/number/boolean/enum with no
  secret type, and client support is uneven. (parked by 001)
- Hosted HTTP transport with OAuth 2.1 for true multi-tenancy. The SDK ships a
  full authorization server under server/auth/. BLOCKER: B2 has no OAuth flow
  for application keys, so this means a custom auth layer plus custody of other
  people's credentials, and it is the only option with a recurring hosting
  bill. (parked by 001)

## Done

- List buckets over MCP: stdio server exposing b2_list_buckets. (001)
- .env file loading. (002) Landed with ZERO dependencies: Node 22's built-in
  process.loadEnvFile replaced the planned dotenv package.
